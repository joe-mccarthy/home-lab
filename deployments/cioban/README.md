# Cioban Deployment

This project provides an automated solution for deploying and managing the **Cioban** stack in a Docker Swarm cluster using Ansible. It is designed to ensure scalability, high availability, and secure integration with external services.

## Overview

The deployment process uses Ansible playbooks and roles to prepare the environment, configure Docker Swarm, and deploy the stack. It includes support for managing secrets, setting up NFS directories, and integrating with external services like reverse proxies and DNS providers.

## Features

- **Docker Swarm Integration**: Deploys services across a Swarm cluster for high availability and scalability.
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Uses Ansible Vault and Docker secrets to handle sensitive data securely.
- **NFS Support**: Ensures required directories are created and mounted for persistent storage.
- **Modular Roles**: Simplifies maintenance and reusability with dedicated roles for tasks like NFS setup, Docker configuration, and stack deployment.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to add new services or adapt to specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

To deploy the stack, you need a Docker Swarm cluster, Ansible installed on the control machine, and access to an NFS server. Secrets and configuration values must be defined and encrypted using Ansible Vault.

## Deployment Process

The deployment involves preparing the environment, ensuring the required directory structure exists, and deploying the stack using Docker Swarm. The process is automated through Ansible playbooks and roles, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## Security Considerations

The deployment emphasizes security by encrypting sensitive data, restricting permissions, and using Docker secrets for secure communication between services. It is recommended to test configurations in a staging environment before applying them to production.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues such as missing directories, uninitialized Docker Swarm, or misconfigured secrets can be resolved by verifying the environment setup and reviewing Ansible playbook logs.
