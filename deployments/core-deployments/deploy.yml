# This playbook is responsible for deploying the core services of the cluster.
# These services are essential for the functionality, management, and security of the cluster.
# Each service is defined in its own playbook, and this file imports them sequentially.

# Import the Traefik deployment playbook
- import_playbook: ../traefik/deploy.yml
  # Traefik is a reverse proxy that handles:
  # - Routing traffic to services based on domain names.
  # - Issuing and managing HTTPS certificates via DNS challenges.
  # - Acting as a gateway for external access to internal services.

# Import the Portainer deployment playbook
- import_playbook: ../portainer/deploy.yml
  # Portainer provides a web-based UI for managing Docker and Docker Swarm.
  # - It allows monitoring of the cluster's status and activity.
  # - While Ansible manages deployments, Portainer offers a convenient interface for manual management.

# Import the Dynamic DNS deployment playbook
- import_playbook: ../ddns/deploy.yml
  # Dynamic DNS ensures that the cluster's services are accessible via domain names.
  # - It updates DNS records dynamically to reflect the public IP address of the internet gateway.
  # - This playbook assumes the use of the Cloudflare API for DNS updates.

# Import the Cioban deployment playbook
- import_playbook: ../cioban/deploy.yml
  # Cioban is responsible for automatically updating Docker services.
  # - It monitors services for new Docker image versions.
  # - When a new image is detected, it updates the service according to its deployment policies.
  # - This ensures that services remain up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

# Import the NFS Backup deployment playbook
- import_playbook: ../nfs-backup/deploy.yml
  # NFS Backup is responsible for backing up critical NFS shares used by the cluster.
  # - It schedules regular backups of important data from services like Home Assistant.
  # - Supports incremental backups to optimize storage usage.
  # - Provides data redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities.
  # - Ensures data persistence across container and host failures.
