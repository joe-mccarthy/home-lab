# This task file is responsible for deploying Gitea runners (act_runner) using Docker Swarm.
# It ensures that Docker and docker-compose are installed and running, removes any existing services,
# sets up the required directory structure, deploys the runner stack, and cleans up temporary files.

- name: Ensure docker-compose is installed
  ansible.builtin.package:
    name: docker-compose  # The package name for docker-compose.
    state: present  # Ensure docker-compose is installed on the target system.
  # This task ensures that docker-compose is available for managing Docker-based applications.

- name: Ensure Docker service is running
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: docker  # The name of the Docker service.
    state: started  # Ensure the Docker service is running.
    enabled: true  # Ensure the Docker service starts on boot.
  # This task ensures that the Docker daemon is active and ready to manage containers.

- name: Remove existing Gitea runner services
  docker_swarm_service:
    name: gitea_runner  # The name of the Docker Swarm service to remove (stack_name + service_name).
    state: absent  # Ensure the service is removed.
  ignore_errors: true  # Allow the playbook to continue even if this task fails.
  # This task removes any existing instance of the Gitea runner service to avoid conflicts during deployment.

- name: Setup Gitea runner directory
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /home/docker-compose/gitea-runner # The path to the directory to be created.
    state: directory  # Ensure the path is a directory.
    mode: '0755'  # Set the directory permissions (read, write, execute for owner; read and execute for others).
    owner: nobody  # Set the directory owner to `nobody`.
    group: nogroup  # Set the directory group to `nogroup`.
  # This task creates the directory structure required for the Gitea runner deployment.

- name: Copy compose from template to host
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: "templates/runners/docker-compose.yml"  # Path to the Jinja2 template for the docker-compose file.
    dest: "/home/docker-compose/gitea-runner/docker-compose.yaml"  # Destination path for the docker-compose file.
    mode: '0755'  # Set the file permissions (read, write, execute for owner; read and execute for others).
    owner: nobody  # Set the file owner to `nobody`.
    group: nogroup  # Set the file group to `nogroup`.
  # This task copies the docker-compose template to the target system, ensuring it is ready for runner deployment.

- name: Deploy Gitea Runner stack
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: docker stack deploy -c /home/docker-compose/gitea-runner/docker-compose.yaml gitea
    # The `docker stack deploy` command deploys the runner stack using the specified compose file.
    # - `-c`: Specifies the path to the docker-compose file.
    # - `gitea_runner`: The name of the stack to deploy (contains the Gitea runners).
  register: swarm_check  # Store the output of the command in the `swarm_check` variable.
  changed_when: false  # Ensure this task does not mark the playbook as "changed."
  # This task deploys the Gitea runner stack to the Docker Swarm cluster.

- name: delete compose directory
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: rm -rf /home/docker-compose  # Remove the temporary directory and its contents.
  # This task cleans up the temporary files and directories created during the deployment process.

# Notes:
# - Ensure that Docker and Docker Swarm are properly configured on the target system before running this playbook.
# - The `docker-compose.yml` template should define the Gitea act_runner service with proper environment variables.
# - The runner requires GITEA_INSTANCE_URL and GITEA_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN to be configured in group_vars.
# - The registration token should be encrypted in vault_gitea.runner_token and referenced in group_vars/all.yml.
# - The cleanup step (`delete compose directory`) is optional and can be removed if the compose files need to be retained.
# - Use caution when setting permissions (`0755`) and ownership (`nobody:nogroup`) to avoid security risks.
# - The runner connects to the main Gitea instance to provide CI/CD capabilities for repositories.
# - Each runner instance will be deployed globally across all swarm nodes with unique hostnames.
# - Always test the deployment in a staging environment before applying it to production.
