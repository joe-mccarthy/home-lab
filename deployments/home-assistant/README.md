# Home Assistant Deployment

This project provides an automated solution for deploying and managing **Home Assistant** using Ansible. Home Assistant is an open-source platform for home automation that allows you to control and integrate various smart devices and services. The deployment is designed to ensure reliability, scalability, and secure configuration.

## Overview

The deployment uses Ansible playbooks and roles to automate the setup and configuration of Home Assistant in a Docker Swarm environment. It includes tasks for preparing the environment, managing persistent storage, and integrating with reverse proxies for secure access.

## Features

- **Home Automation Platform**: Deploys a fully functional Home Assistant instance for managing and automating smart devices.
- **Docker Swarm Integration**: Ensures high availability and scalability by deploying Home Assistant as a service in a Swarm cluster.
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Uses Ansible Vault to securely store sensitive data like user credentials and API keys.
- **Persistent Storage**: Configures NFS directories to ensure data persistence for configurations, logs, and automation files.
- **Reverse Proxy Integration**: Supports integration with reverse proxies like Traefik for HTTPS and domain-based routing.

## Prerequisites

To deploy Home Assistant, you need a Docker Swarm cluster, Ansible installed on the control machine, and access to an NFS server for persistent storage. Configuration values and secrets must be defined and encrypted using Ansible Vault.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process involves preparing the environment, ensuring the required directory structure exists, and deploying the Home Assistant stack using Docker Swarm. The Ansible playbooks automate these tasks, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## Security Considerations

The deployment emphasizes security by encrypting sensitive data, restricting permissions on configuration files, and integrating with reverse proxies for secure HTTPS access. It is recommended to test the deployment in a staging environment before applying it to production.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues such as missing directories, uninitialized Docker Swarm, or misconfigured secrets can be resolved by verifying the environment setup and reviewing Ansible playbook logs.
