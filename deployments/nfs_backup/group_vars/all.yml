# Encryption key for backup files
# ------------------------------
# This variable stores the encryption password used to secure the restic backup repository
# It is retrieved from Ansible Vault using the vault_file_encryption_key variable
# The encryption key is critical for both creating backups and for restoration operations
# Without this key, backup data cannot be decrypted or accessed
#
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Never store the actual encryption key in plain text
# 2. Ensure the vault file containing this key is properly secured
# 3. Document the key in a secure password manager or key management system
# 4. Loss of this key will result in permanent inability to restore backups
#
# This key is used by all three services:
# - backup service: To encrypt data during backup operations
# - prune service: To access the repository for cleanup operations
# - check service: To verify repository integrity
file_encryption_key: "{{ vault_file_encryption_key }}"
