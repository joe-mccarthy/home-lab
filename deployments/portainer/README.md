# Portainer Deployment

This project provides an automated solution for deploying and managing **Portainer** and **Portainer Agents** in Docker Swarm mode using Ansible. Portainer is a lightweight management UI that simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing Docker environments, including standalone Docker hosts and Swarm clusters.

## Overview

The deployment uses Ansible playbooks and roles to automate the setup and configuration of Portainer and its agents in a Docker Swarm environment. It includes tasks for preparing the environment, managing persistent storage, and securely configuring Portainer for managing containerized workloads.

## Features

- **Portainer Management UI**: Deploys Portainer to provide a centralized interface for managing Docker environments.
- **Portainer Agents**: Deploys agents on all Swarm nodes to enable communication between Portainer and the cluster.
- **Docker Swarm Integration**: Ensures high availability and scalability by deploying Portainer and its agents in Swarm mode.
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Uses Ansible Vault to securely store sensitive data like admin passwords.
- **Persistent Storage**: Configures NFS directories to ensure data persistence for Portainer's configuration and logs.
- **Reverse Proxy Integration**: Supports integration with reverse proxies like Traefik for HTTPS and domain-based routing.

## Prerequisites

To deploy Portainer, you need a Docker Swarm cluster, Ansible installed on the control machine, and access to an NFS server for persistent storage. Configuration values and secrets must be defined and encrypted using Ansible Vault.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process involves preparing the environment, ensuring the required directory structure exists, and deploying the Portainer stack using Docker Swarm. The Ansible playbooks automate these tasks, ensuring consistency and reliability. Portainer agents are deployed globally across all Swarm nodes to enable seamless management of the cluster.

## Security Considerations

The deployment emphasizes security by encrypting sensitive data, restricting permissions on configuration files, and integrating with reverse proxies for secure HTTPS access. It is recommended to test the deployment in a staging environment before applying it to production.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues such as missing directories, uninitialized Docker Swarm, or misconfigured secrets can be resolved by verifying the environment setup and reviewing Ansible playbook logs.
