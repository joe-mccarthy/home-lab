# RCLONE CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
# ------------------------------
#
# This file contains variables used by the rClone deployment playbook
# to configure authentication and access to the rClone web UI.
# All sensitive information is retrieved from Ansible Vault for security.

# Username for rClone Web UI authentication
# This variable retrieves the username from the Ansible Vault to keep credentials secure
# The vault_rclone_user should be defined in a secure vault file (e.g., vault.yml)
# This username is used to restrict access to the rClone web interface (rcd --rc-web-gui)
# It is NOT used for authenticating with cloud storage providers, but only for the UI itself
rclone_user: "{{ vault_rclone_user }}"

# Password for rClone Web UI authentication
# This variable retrieves the password from the Ansible Vault to keep credentials secure
# The vault_rclone_password should be defined in a secure vault file (e.g., vault.yml)
# This password is used in conjunction with the username to restrict access to the rClone web interface
# It provides basic authentication for the web UI, protecting your rClone configuration
#
# SECURITY NOTE: Never store plain-text passwords in this file. Always use Ansible Vault
# for sensitive information to prevent unauthorized access to your UI credentials.
rclone_password: "{{ vault_rclone_password }}"

# NOTE: Actual cloud storage credentials should be configured through the rClone web UI
# or directly in the rClone configuration file after deployment.
# The container maps the config directory to /mnt/nfs/docker/rclone/config for persistence.
