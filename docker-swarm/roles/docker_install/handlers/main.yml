# This handler file is responsible for restarting the Docker service.
# Handlers in Ansible are triggered by tasks when changes occur, ensuring that dependent services
# are restarted or reloaded only when necessary. In this case, the Docker service is restarted
# to apply configuration changes or updates made during the playbook execution.

- name: Restart Docker
  ansible.builtin.systemd:  # Use the `systemd` module to manage system services.
    name: docker  # The name of the service to manage. In this case, it is the Docker service.
    state: restarted  # Ensure the service is restarted.
    # The `state: restarted` parameter stops and then starts the service, ensuring that any changes
    # to the Docker configuration or installation are applied.

# Notes:
# - This handler is typically triggered by tasks that modify Docker-related configurations,
#   such as installing Docker, updating its configuration files, or modifying system dependencies.
# - Restarting Docker will temporarily stop all running containers, so use this handler with caution
#   in production environments.
# - Ensure that the `docker` service is installed and managed by `systemd` on the target system.
# - If the service name differs (e.g., `docker.service`), update the `name` parameter accordingly.
# - Handlers are only executed when notified by a task, reducing unnecessary restarts.
