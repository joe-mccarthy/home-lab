# This task file is responsible for setting up an NFS (Network File System) server.
# It installs the necessary dependencies, configures the NFS exports, creates the required directories,
# and ensures that the NFS server is properly configured and running.

- name: install nfs server dependencies
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"  # Install the specified NFS-related packages.
    state: present  # Ensure the packages are installed.
  with_items:
  - nfs-kernel-server  # Provides the NFS server functionality.
  - nfs-common  # Provides the NFS client utilities for mounting NFS shares.
  # This task ensures that the required NFS packages are installed on the system.

- name: Reload systemd to recognize NFS changes
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    daemon_reload: true  # Reload the systemd manager configuration.
  # This task ensures that systemd recognizes any changes made to the NFS configuration.

- name: Create a directory if it does not exist
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /exports/docker  # The path to the directory to be created.
    state: directory  # Ensure the path is a directory.
    mode: '7777'  # Set the directory permissions to allow full access (read, write, execute) for all users.
    owner: nobody  # Set the directory owner to `nobody`.
    group: nogroup  # Set the directory group to `nogroup`.
  # This task ensures that the directory for exporting the NFS volume exists with the correct permissions.

- name: Copy exports file to host
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: "templates/exports.j2"  # Path to the Jinja2 template for the NFS exports configuration.
    dest: "/etc/exports"  # Destination path for the NFS exports configuration file.
    mode: '7777'  # Set the file permissions to allow full access (read, write, execute) for all users.
    owner: nobody  # Set the file owner to `nobody`.
    group: nogroup  # Set the file group to `nogroup`.
  notify:
  - Restart NFS Server  # Notify the handler to restart the NFS server after the configuration is updated.
  # This task copies the NFS exports configuration file to the target system and ensures it has the correct permissions.

# Notes:
# - The `nfs-kernel-server` package is required to provide NFS server functionality.
# - The `/exports/docker` directory is the location where the NFS share will be exported.
# - The `templates/exports.j2` file should define the NFS export rules, such as which clients can access the share
#   and their permissions (e.g., read-only or read-write).
# - The `notify` directive ensures that the NFS server is restarted after the exports file is updated.
# - The `7777` permissions on the directory and file are very permissive and should be adjusted based on your security requirements.
# - Ensure that the NFS server is properly configured to allow access from the intended clients.
